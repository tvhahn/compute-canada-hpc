The VAE then samples randomly from a Gaussian distribution, with the same mean and standard deviation created by the encoder, to generate the latent variables, $\\boldsymbol{z}$. These latent variables are then “decoded” to reconstruct the input. The figure below demonstrates how a signal is reconstructed using the VAE. \n",

One factor may encode information on how pointy the shape is, while another factor may look at how round it is. However, in a VAE, the factors are often entangled together across the codings (the latent variables). Tuning the hyper-parameter $\\beta$, to a value larger than one, can enable the factors to disentangle such that each coding only represents one factor at a time. Thus, greater interpretability of the model can be obtained. A VAE with a tunable beta is often called a disentangled-variational-autoencoder, or simply, a $\\beta$-VAE. "

Google Colab has access to great GPUs, but your time with them is limited, so it makes sense to maximize the use of the GPUs on them this way.
